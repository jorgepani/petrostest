Assumptions 
==============================

1st meaningful commit
- assuming that we need to assembly a jar and run it on console
- assuming that no matter the way I read the jar just need to be sure it get's the triangle
- assuming the triangle is composed by integers to create a parser
- It's been ages since last time I was using stdin and a jar but I'll manage it

Archieved to read from console using fs2 with
cat << EOF | java -jar petrostest-assembly-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

2nd commit
- I decided to use a Vector to move inside the triangle in an easy way
- Creating and testing a parser

3rd commit
- I thought about a basic recursive solution but this has the potential to break the stack
- This is because the same path could be processed several times so the complexity could become exponential
- I'll first evaluate a bottom-up solution with a complexity of O(nÂ²)

4th commit
- I don't like this idea, it's been more or less easy but using mutable objects...
- I also remember our conversation in the interview when I asked about if you have any 
- eventual consistency issues or race conditions with your clients and I think my code should
- work with that. I'm trying to figure out an idea using FP and recursion and 
- I also would like to go from top to bottom and make the path in just one shot 
- Trying to do it from top without any protections at all
